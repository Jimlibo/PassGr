## Project for the Software Engineerig course, 7th Semester 2021/22


**Description**

The purpose of this software is the interoperability of the tolls for the Greek highways with different systems of automatic passage. More specifically, the systems that will be involved are: aodos.gr, gefyra.gr, gregnatia.eu, kentrikiodos.gr, moreas.com.gr, neaodos.gr, olympiaodos.gr.

Highway Providers will have access to debts to other providers as well as statistics related to highways. Every user of the highways will have the opportunity through a single transceiver to make crossings on every Greek highway. The management system will be independent of the providers and will be able to access specific data from them.

**Use Cases**

1) Highway Providers have the oportunity through this system to view, manage and pay their depts throught the application easy and with safety. 

2) Highway Providers and the Transportation Authority have the opportunity to view statistics for the vehicles transits for a specific highway statin and for the selected dates. 

**Safety**

Safety is the number one priority for our users. We are implementing the newest technologies to ensure that their data will be safe. Specifically, we are implementing the HTTPS Protocol and SSL Certificate.
